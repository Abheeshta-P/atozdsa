# Number Comparison

## Problem Statement

Programming languages have some conditional/decision-making statements that execute when a specific condition is fulfilled. If-else is one of the ways to implement them.

You are given two numbers 'a' and 'b'. Compare the numbers and print the relation. Print “smaller”, “greater”, or “equal” when ‘a’ is smaller than ‘b’, greater than ‘b’, or equal to ‘b’ respectively.

### Example:

**Input:** 'a' = 5 and 'b' = 3

**Output:** greater

**Explanation:** Since ‘a’ (5) is greater than ‘b’ (3), we print “greater”.

### Expected Time Complexity:

The expected time complexity is O(1).

### Constraints:

-10^5 <= ‘a’ <= 10^5
-10^5 <= ‘b’ <= 10^5

Time limit: 1 second
