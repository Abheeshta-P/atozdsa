#  Alpha ramp

## Problem Statement
Sam is curious about Alpha-Ramp, so he decided to create Alpha-Ramp of different sizes.

An Alpha-Ramp is represented by a triangle, where alphabets are filled from the top in order.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to return the corresponding Alpha-Ramp.

### Example:

**Input:** `N` = 3

**Output:** 
```
A
B B
C C C
```

### Constraints :

1 <= N <= 25

Time Limit: 1 second

## Solutions

### Java Solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public static void alphaRamp(int n) {
    // Write your code here.
    char letter='A';
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
        for(int j=1;j<=i;j++)
        System.out.print(letter+" ");
        System.out.println();
        letter++;
    }
}
}
```

###  C++ Solution:

```cpp
void alphaRamp(int n) {
    // Write your code here.
    char letter='A';
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
        for(int j=1;j<=i;j++)
        cout<<letter<<" ";
        cout<<endl;
        letter++;
    }
}

```

### Explanation
- Outer loop runs from 1 to n and inner loop from 1 to i so that in each i there are i columns
- uses letter variable to print the letter according to the pattern having diffrent letter in diffrent row

##### We can use letter = 'A'+i and start i from 0 as alternate approach
