# Concentric rectangle

## Problem Statement
Ninja has been given a task to print the required pattern and he asked for your help with the same.

You must print a matrix corresponding to the given number pattern.

### Example:

**Input:** `N` = 3

**Output:** 
```
3 3 3 3 3 
3 2 2 2 3 
3 2 1 2 3 
3 2 2 2 3 
3 3 3 3 3
```

### Constraints :

1  <= N <= 10^2

Time Limit: 1 second

## Solution

### Java Solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public static void concetricRectangle(int n) {
        void getNumberPattern(int n) {
    for(int i=0;i<2*n-1;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<2*n-1;j++){
            int left=j;
            int right=2*n-2-j;
            int up=i;
            int down=2*n-2-i;
           System.out.print(n-Math.min(Math.min(left,right).Math.min(up,down)));
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
}
    }
```

###  C++ Solution:

```cpp
void concentricRectangle(int n) {
       void getNumberPattern(int n) {
    for(int i=0;i<2*n-1;i++){
        for(int j=0;j<2*n-1;j++){
            int left=j;
            int right=2*n-2-j;
            int up=i;
            int down=2*n-2-i;
            cout<<n-min(min(left,right),min(up,down));
        }
        cout<<endl;
    }
}
}
```

### Explanation
- we can observe that on the perimeter of the square, there is an integer no. n which decreases by 1 as we move inside the square level-wise.

- Since this cannot be printed directly, we print it in reverse fashion (0â€™s at the border of the square, then 1 in the inner perimeter, then 2, and so on ) 

- We use two nested loops to iterate over each cell of the matrix.

- For each cell, we calculate its distance to the left, right, top, and bottom edges of the matrix.
Then, we find the minimum distance among these four directions.

- Then subtract the whole pattern by n at the end which just makes the outermost perimeter filled with the number n, inner perimeter with n-1 and finally the centermost element with the integer 1.
