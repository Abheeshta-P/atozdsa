# Increasing Number Triangle Pattern

## Problem Statement
Aryan and his friends are very fond of patterns. For a given integer ‘N’, they want to make the Increasing Number Triangle.

### Example:

**Input:** `N` = 3

**Output:** 
```
1
2 3
4 5 6
```

### Constraints :

1 <= N <= 25

Time Limit: 1 second

## Solutions

### Java Solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public static void nNumberTriangle(int n) {
    // Write your code here.
    int num=1;
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
      for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        System.out.print(num+ " ");
        num++;
      }
      System.out.println();
    }
}
}
```

###  C++ Solution:

```cpp
void nNumberTriangle(int n) {
    // Write your code here.
    int num=1;
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
      for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        cout << num << " ";
        num++;
      }
      cout<<endl;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- Outer loop runs from 1 to n and inner loop from 1 to i so that in each i there are i columns
- uses num variable to print the number in increasing order following the pattern
