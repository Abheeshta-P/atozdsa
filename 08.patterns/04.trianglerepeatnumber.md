# N-Dimensional Triangle Painter

## Problem Statement

Sam is making a Triangular painting for a math project.

An N-dimensional Triangle is represented by the lower triangle of the pattern filled with integers representing the row number.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to print the corresponding Triangle.

### Example:

**Input:** `N` = 3

**Output:** 
```
1
2 2
3 3 3
```

### Constraints :

1 <= N <= 25

Time Limit: 1 second

## Solutions

### Java Solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public static void nTriangle(int n) {
        // Write your code here
	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
		for(int j=1;j<=i;j++){
			System.out.print(i+" ");
		}
		System.out.println();
	}
}
}
```

###  C++ Solution:

```cpp
void triangle(int n) {
	// Write your code here
	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
		for(int j=1;j<=i;j++){
			cout<<i<<" ";
		}
		cout<<endl;
	}
}
```

### Explanation
- Both solutions use nested loops to print the lower triangle pattern of integers starting from 1 for the given value of 'N'.
- The outer loop iterates over the rows of the triangle, and the inner loop iterates over the columns to print integers starting from 1 and increasing in each row.
- i is used to print the row number .
