# Functions Coding Challenge

## Problem Statement

Take this coding challenge to test your coding skills in:

- Defining a function
- Passing arguments by value to a function
- Passing arguments by reference to a function

This coding challenge is organized in the following way:

The first line of input reads an integer to select the coding challenge:

- Reading value '1' selects coding challenge 1 (tests the ability to define a function and pass arguments by value).
- Reading value '2' selects coding challenge 2 (tests the ability to pass arguments by reference to a function).

### Coding Challenge 1

Define a function named "Maximum" that accepts two integers (passed by value) as arguments and returns the greatest of the two arguments.

### Coding Challenge 2

Define a function named "Swap" that accepts two integers (passed by reference) as arguments and swaps their values.

### Expected Time Complexity

The expected time complexity is O(1).

### Constraints

- 1 <= 'test' <= 2
- 0 <= 'a', 'b' <= 10^9

Time limit: 1 second
