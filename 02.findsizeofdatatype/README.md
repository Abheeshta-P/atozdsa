# Data Type Size

## Problem Statement

Data type refers to the type of value a variable has and the way the computer interprets it. Each data type has a different size. You’ve studied 5 different data types and the sizes of the data types:

- Integer: 4 bytes
- Long: 8 bytes
- Float: 4 bytes
- Double: 8 bytes
- Character: 1 byte

You’re given a data type. Print its size in bytes.

### Example :

**Input:** Long

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** The size of a Long variable is given as 8 bytes.

### Expected Time Complexity:

The expected time complexity is O(1).

### Constraints:

‘type’ is one of the data types given above.

Time limit: 1 second

### Hints:

Think about how you can use conditional statements (like if-else or switch) to determine the data type provided as input and then print its corresponding size in bytes.
