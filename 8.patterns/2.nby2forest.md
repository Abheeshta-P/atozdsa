# N/2-Dimensional Forest Visualizer

## Problem Statement

Sam is making a forest visualizer. An N-dimensional forest is represented by the pattern of size NxN filled with ‘*’.

An N/2-dimensional forest is represented by the lower triangle of the pattern filled with ‘*’.

For every value of ‘N’, help Sam to print the corresponding N/2-dimensional forest.

### Example:

**Input:** `N` = 3

**Output:** 

```
* 
* *
* * *
```

### Constraints :

1 <= N <= 25

Time Limit: 1 second

## Solutions

### Java Solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public static void nBy2Forest(int n) {
        // Write your code here
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<=i;j++){
                System.out.print("* ");
            }
            System.out.println("");
        }
    }
}
```

###  C++ Solution:

```cpp
void nBy2Forest(int n) {
	// Write your code here.
	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<=i;j++){
               cout<<"*"<<" ";
            }
           cout<<endl;
        }
}

```

### Explanation
- Both solutions use nested loops to print the lower triangle of the pattern of '*' characters for the given value of 'N'.
- The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns to print '*' characters.
- Each '*' character is followed by a space to separate the characters and create the forest pattern.
